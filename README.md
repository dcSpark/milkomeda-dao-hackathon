# Milkomeda DAO Hacktahon
Milkomeda Foundation invites all builders around the world to come together and create the tools and solutions for decentralized governance in Cardano.

## General Information
With Milkomeda, DAOs can be launched using the mature EVM-based ecosystem. 
We would like to thank [Catalyst Community](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) for supporting our [proposal in Fund 7](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/383465) and our Media Partners and Judges. 

## Dates and Timing
- September 5th - Hackathon launch
- September 6th - 27th - Hacking

## Hackathon Challenges 
The hackathon consists of different team challenges focused on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in the Cardano/Milkomeda ecosystem.

- UI for DAOs
- Tooling for DAOs
- Social DAOs
- DeFi DAOs
- Bootstrapping DAOs
- Other DAO ideas

### Winners Announcement

## First Place: [Oracle DAO](https://github.com/hatskier/oracle-dao)

### Team Name
Alex Suvorov

### Project Description
Oracles need an efficient and self-sustainable way of getting data that are later put on blockchain. This can be achieved in several different ways like using official government sources or well-known media, however even the most honest websites are prone to mistakes and hacks. If the incorrect data are later used in DeFi protocols, this could cause a massive shake-ups on the market.

DAO for data providers will allow to create a reliable ecosystem rewarding true information while penalizing data providers who are wrong. Such a solution creates a decentralized and automated ecosystem, where everyone can take part in verification of the data. This also helps to automate the process and allows to provide oracles not only with simple price feeds but also with all kinds of off-chain world information.

The project has been built on Milkomeda which is an EVM-compatible Cardano rollup and it is connected to RedStone EVM-compatible oracle. This setup opens the project up for a fast-growing ecosystem.

## Second Place: [EventDAO](https://github.com/monika-zajac-krypto/events-dao-app)

### Team Name
Monika ZajÄ…c

### Project Description
Crypto communities are scattered all over the world, while crypto events prioritize the biggest hubs. For many people it is hard or even impossible to travel to popular crypto events destinations like the United States, not only because of the expenses, but also because of visa requirements. These people could meet locally but to organize, they need the right tools.

Event organization can be a full-time job but many enthusiasts sacrifice their own free time and sometimes even their own money to organize events for the community. Often there is more than one person responsible for organization and the questions about task management and decision making arise.

Free beer and pizza are a standard for crypto meetups but they require sponsors. Harder than finding one is agreeing to a form of settlement. Sponsors don't want to entrust their money to a single person, they want to make a donation to an organization.

EventDAO aims to solve all these problems. It will make organizing events easier and crowdfunding less messy.

DAO voting will improve decision making both in the communities, but also in the groups of independent event organizers.

Our tool also offers internal and external crowdfunding options making finance management transparent and trustless. Communities can fund their own small meetups in a coordinated manner while they can also easily manage external sponsors who prefer working with organizations rather than private people.

A proper tool for bottom-up event organization will result in more quality events wherever there are communities willing to meet.

## Third Place: [Consensus-meter](https://github.com/consenz-io/consensus-meter)

### Team Name
Consensus Meter 

### Project Description
Consenz is a platform for creating agreements. The platform lets a group of people create a document that reflects the issues they agree upon and discuss the issues that are in disagreement.

The consensus meter is an algorithm that determine an agreement threshold: A number that represent how many supporters needed to approve an edit suggestion to an agreement document. The threshold is always a percentage of the total sum of users in a document at given time. For this project we have created a simulation of the consensus meter to demonstrate it's behavior at a scale and to set a base for future improvements and optimization.
